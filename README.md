## SF Housing Alerts

General plan:
- scrape CL periodically (no need to spam)
- maintain database of alerts (what people want to see)
- any time there's a new posting, see if it matches the alert criteria, and if it does, send an email / text message
- support: price, search query, number of bedrooms (that should be enough for an MVP)

To dedupe repeat listing:
- maintain internal state of all new cl housing postings for the area within the past period of time (This is not MVP!)
- compare new listings against previous postings

To improve geographical area:
- let people draw boxes on areas they're willing to look in
- support districts

Ideas for marketing:
- ???
- there exist facebook groups out there for SF housing searching
- reddit / HN?
- SEO?
- Marketing?
